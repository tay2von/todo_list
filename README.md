# Why I built this?
While pursuing my degree in computer science, I decided to learn a new framework in 1 month. I am always seeking new challenges. This was a huge challenge and taught me a lot of skills I can transfer into other areas of web development! Because this is a newer framework, it taught me how to properly communicate and network with other developers when I ran into issues. 

# To Do List
This is a simple To Do List Application built using Phoenix Live View and Elixir. 

## Getting Started
To use the app, all you have to do is type in a task that you need to complete. You can add as many tasks as you want. Once your task is complete, just click mark complete.

## What I love
The best thing about I like about this web app is how it is updated live. Anyone across the world can add to-do's and it will be updated live.
